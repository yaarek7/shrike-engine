# Chess Engine

An experimental chess engine built in Rust with a correctness-first, measurement-driven
development process.

## Status

Milestone M5 is complete: the engine adds a replaceable classical evaluator with centipawn material,
piece activity, mobility, pawn structure, and king safety components. The UCI process remains
functional, while move choice remains deterministic until search arrives.

## Requirements

- Rust 1.85 or newer
- Cargo

On macOS with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install rust
```

## Local checks

Run the same quality gates used by CI:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-targets --all-features --locked
RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc --no-deps --all-features --locked
cargo build --release --locked
```

Apply formatting with:

```sh
cargo fmt --all
```

## Engineering principles

- Correctness is established through tests, not inspection alone.
- Performance and playing-strength claims require measurements.
- Each experiment changes one independent variable.
- The binary remains thin; engine behavior belongs in testable library modules.
- Unsafe Rust is forbidden until a future benchmark and architecture decision justify it.
- Architectural decisions and experimental outcomes are recorded in the repository.
